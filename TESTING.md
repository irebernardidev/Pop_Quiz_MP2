Throughout the entire development process, I extensively used Chrome Developer Tools for real-time testing and troubleshooting. I leveraged its console feature to ensure JavaScript code functionality and identify any issues.

To verify adaptability, I employed Google Chrome Developer Tools and Firefox's Inspector tool to check the responsiveness of each page across various devices and screen sizes. This rigorous approach ensured a seamless user experience on multiple platforms.
